PPO_GRU_Delta_LiDAR
🛸 PPO-GRU + Delta-LiDAR for UAV Navigation Enhanced Memory-Augmented Deep Reinforcement Learning for UAV Navigation in Partially Observable Environments using PPO + GRU and ΔLiDAR

🧠 Summary This project implements autonomous drone navigation in a 3D simulated environment using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and ΔLiDAR data (LiDAR frame differencing). The agent learns to navigate through static and dynamic obstacles toward a predefined target using only LiDAR information and internal memory (GRU) for better temporal awareness.

📦 Package Name drone_ppogru_delta_nav 🚀 Features ✅ PPO + GRU-based DRL agent ✅ ΔLiDAR input for capturing motion over time ✅ Memory-augmented navigation in partially observable 3D environments ✅ Full integration with ROS Noetic, Gazebo 11, PX4 SITL, and MAVROS ✅ Collision reset, reward shaping, goal-checking ✅ Generalization to unseen dynamic environments

🧭 System Overview Component Description Simulator Gazebo 11 Flight Controller PX4 Autopilot (Software-In-The-Loop) Middleware MAVROS + ROS Noetic DRL Algorithm PPO + GRU (via Stable-Baselines3) Sensor 720° 2D LiDAR (with frame differencing Δ) Input Topic /scan Goal Coordinates (33, -2, 0)
